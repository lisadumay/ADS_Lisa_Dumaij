**1. DataCamp**

For this minor I used DataCamp. This wasn't my first time using DataCamp, I used this program last year for my engineering business studies degree. As a result, there was also an overlap in the courses I had to do for this minor.
Because I had already completed some courses, I didn't get extra points if I did them again and it wasn't in the leaderboard either. The screenshots of the completed courses can be found in Appendix I.

*1.1	Introduction to Python*
: Because I had done this course before, it was relatively easy for me. It was nice to use this course as a refresher. It had been half a year ago that I had used python, which had wiped it out a bit

*1.2	Intermediate Python*
: I had also completed this course before. In the first chapter I liked making plots again. Last year I found making data visualizations and in this course that came back for a while. This chapter also went fairly quickly. In the second chapter the import of CSV was discussed. I later also used this code for the project, see as an example !!!!!! . The last chapters were already a bit more complicated, making loops was already complicated last year.

*1.3	Python Data Science toolbox*
: I found the first part of the data science toolbox complicated, because I did not fully understand the subject, so I looked up videos on YouTube for additional explanation. In addition, kept in the slides next to the assignment. This allowed me to look back at how they had done it in the video. This made the material a bit clearer. I found the second part of this course easier, I understood the material reasonably well and went through it faster than the course before. However, I also sometimes kept the slides with this course to look back at how it was done in the video.

*1.4	Statistical Thinking in Python*
: I found this course very interesting. I already had a lot of statistics in my education, but never done this in Python. I really liked this combination, which made me feel like I completed the course quickly. I understood the stat behind it which made the steps in python make sense to me as well.

*1.5	Supervised Learning with scikit-learn*
: From this course I used the code of splitting your dataset into train, test, validation set. This can be found in !!!! . In addition, I have worked together with Mustafa and individually on a Lasso model. This can be found in !!! or !!! . I also used scaling of the data in the project. This can be seen in !!! . This course was also new to me, everything I had learned in this course was new to me, being able to apply it in the project in combination with the lessons made sure that I understood it better.

*1.6	Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib*
: Data visualization has been one of my strengths in python so far, which made this course easy for me. In addition, I had already done this course and my previous python was mainly about making the visualizations. After this course I was busy making different visualizations for the project. This can be found in !!! . I found this course interesting for all the adjustment of the graphs in terms of colors and axes.
