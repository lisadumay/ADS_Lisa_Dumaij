**1. DataCamp**

For this minor I used DataCamp. This wasn't my first time using DataCamp, I used this program last year for my engineering business studies degree. As a result, there was also an overlap in the courses I had to do for this minor.
Because I had already completed some courses, I didn't get extra points if I did them again and it wasn't in the leaderboard either. The screenshots of the completed courses can be found in Appendix I.

*1.1	Introduction to Python: *
Because I had done this course before, it was relatively easy for me. It was nice to use this course as a refresher. It had been half a year ago that I had used python, which had wiped it out a bit

*1.2	Intermediate Python: *
I had also completed this course before. In the first chapter I liked making plots again. Last year I found making data visualizations and in this course that came back for a while. This chapter also went fairly quickly. In the second chapter the import of CSV was discussed. I later also used this code for the project, see as an example !!!!!! . The last chapters were already a bit more complicated, making loops was already complicated last year.

*1.3	Python Data Science toolbox: *
