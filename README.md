  <summary>1. DataCamp</summary>
  For this minor I used DataCamp. This wasn't my first time using DataCamp, I used this program last year for my engineering business studies degree. As a result, there was also an overlap in the courses I had to do for this minor. Because I had already completed some courses, I didn't get extra points if I did them again and it wasn't in the leaderboard either.
