  For this minor I used DataCamp. This wasn't my first time using DataCamp, I used this program last year for my engineering business studies degree. As a result, there was also an overlap in the courses I had to do for this minor. Because I had already completed some courses, I didn't get extra points if I did them again and it wasn't in the leaderboard either.

  <summary>1.1 Introduction to Python</summary>
    Because I had done this course before, it was relatively easy for me. It was nice to use this course as a refresher. It had been half a year ago that I had used python, which had wiped it out a bit

  <summary>1.2 Intermediate Python </summary>
    I had also completed this course before. In the first chapter I liked making plots again. Last year I found making data visualizations and in this course that came back for a while. This chapter also went fairly quickly. In the second chapter the import of CSV was discussed. I later also used this code for the project, see as an example !!!!!! . The last chapters were already a bit more complicated, making loops was already complicated last year.

  <summary>1.3 Python Data Science toolbox </summary>
    I found the first part of the data science toolbox complicated, because I did not fully understand the subject, so I looked up videos on YouTube for additional explanation. In addition, kept in the slides next to the assignment. This allowed me to look back at how they had done it in the video. This made the material a bit clearer. I found the second part of this course easier, I understood the material reasonably well and went through it faster than the course before. However, I also sometimes kept the slides with this course to look back at how it was done in the video.

  <summary>1.4 Statistical Thinking in Python </summary>
    I found this course very interesting. I already had a lot of statistics in my education, but never done this in Python. I really liked this combination, which made me feel like I completed the course quickly. I understood the stat behind it which made the steps in python make sense to me as well.
